## Introduction

[Replicate](https://replicate.com) is an online platform for running machine learning models in the cloud. This package provides a revamped client for Replicate's Anonymous API, enabling users to effortlessly run models like [Stable Diffusion](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion), [Whisper](https://replicate.com/openai/whisper), and other advanced models with a more intuitive and modernized API.

## Features

* Anonymous API with enhanced structure for usability üëª.
* Modular and extensible design üõ†Ô∏è.
* Improved error handling and validation üõ°Ô∏è.

## Installation

Install with npm.

```sh
npm i node-replicate
```

## Usage

To run a model, instantiate the `NodeReplicate` class and use its methods.

```js
const model = "owner/model:version";
const input = { prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse" };

const replicate = new NodeReplicate();
await replicate.run(model, input);
```

Monitor the status of pending predictions with the `create` and `get` methods.

```js
let prediction = await replicate.create(model, input);

while (prediction.status !== "succeeded") {
  console.log(prediction.status);
  prediction = await replicate.get(prediction);
}
```
