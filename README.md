# node-replicate

A NodeJS client for Replicate.


```js
import replicate from "node-replicate"


const prediction = await replicate
        .model(
                "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf",
        )
        .predict({
                prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
        })


console.log(prediction.output)

## Introduction

[Replicate](https://replicate.com) is an online platform for running generative AI models in the cloud. This package implements a lightweight client for their [anonymous API](https://replicate.com/explore), allowing you to run Stable Diffusion, CLIP and other state-of-the-art models with only a few lines of code. Those familiar with [`replicate-js`](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-js) should feel right at home ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ.


## Features

* Use any public model on Replicate ðŸ”®.
* Track a model's progress during inference âŒ›.
* Very lightweight - under 100 lines of code! ðŸ•Š.


## Installation

Install with npm:

```
npm i node-replicate
```


## Getting Started

Like `replicate-js`, this package exports `model`, which can be used to access a particular model on Replicate. A model's identifier consists of a *path* (e.g. `stability-ai/stable-diffusion`) and a *version* (e.g. `db21...e5bf`) separated by a colon. You can obtain this information from a model's home page on Replicate.

```js
const model = replicate.model("stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf")
```

Once you've obtained a model identifier, you can run the model using `predict`. This method takes in one or more parameters such as `prompt`. The specific parameters for a model can also be found on its home page (e.g. [https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/api](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/api)).

```js
const prediction = await model.predict({ prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse" })
```

This will return a `Prediction` object containing the model's output, as well as other metadata. The output is a JavaScript object, typically an array, containing one or more results depending on how you queried the model. For instance, most image synthesis models return an array of image URLs.

To track a model's progress during inference, you can specify an `onUpdate` callback:

```js
const prediction = await model.predict(
        {
                prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
        }, {
                onUpdate(prediction) {
                        console.log(prediction.status) 
                }
        }
)
```
